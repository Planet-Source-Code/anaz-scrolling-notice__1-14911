Scrolling Notice-Readme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This was inspired by the form shown by the msn messenger when we log on.I think it will work for all the machines on which VB works.I have commented it where ever I thought necesary although this uses simple code that a starter will understand. Only one Api call, that is to launch the hyperlink(No sites really). You can use some automation to show this form when a new mail arrives or the no. of unread mail or show the connected time to net after a certain interval etc.,
	The basic part is to have a message poping up from the system tray area with a hyperlink in it, then after a while it returns back.If you click the hyperlink the site will be opened.
